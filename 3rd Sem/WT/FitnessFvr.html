        <p style="font-size: 30px;"><b> Importance of Regular Exercise and Balanced Nutrition</b></p>
        <p>
            We all should sweat ourselves at least once a day. Sufficient exercise and enough nutrition are all important and play big roles in our lives. Exercising will actually make you feel better if you are not used to doing it. If you think you don't have at least 30 minutes for yourself from 24 hours or, to be specific, 1440 minutes,  <span class="highlight">it's nothing but your excuse</span class="highlight">.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Those who really wanna stay fit, look good and be physically as well as mentally healthy, will workout regularly and consume a balanced nutrition. Exercising will, kowingly or unkowingly, keep you energitic throughout the day. You will feel motivated and you would not be a sluggard at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Balanced nutrition is also a key factor in our lives. They say it right- <span class="highlight"> 'You are what you eat'  </span class="highlight"> . We be so busy in our lives that most of the us do not give special attention to our diet and that leads to various types of diseases and disorders and those things, frankly speaking, become totally unavoidable <span class="highlight"> once the time goes out of our hands</span class="highlight">.
        <p>
        </p>    
            Timely seriousness about diet and exercise will help you to avoid diabities, obesity, heart problems and various other wide range of problems which may occur in future. In today's world, being physiologically and pshychologically healthy has become too important due increased work load, high stress level, etc. and also because of surge in number of diseases, we need to keep our immunity maximum. All this things are only possible if we intake a balanced diet and perform regular exercise.

        <p>
            If you say you dont have just 30 minutes out of 1440 minutes a day for your own body, it's nothing but your excuse. 'You are what you eat', so be very sensitive about what you eat throughout the day or else, in the long run, you are destined to get certain unavoidable\incurable disease\disorder and you won't be able to do anything once the time, which IS in your hands right now, gone. <span class="highlight">It takes 5 minutes to consume 500 calories.

        <p>
            As we have already converesed about the significance of physical activities, now we will see few flawless ways you can start with your physical training without any gym, protien powder and equipments (though it is your choice to use them or not, here we will try to make use of them as less as possible) to increase your muscle strength, endurance and flexibility.
        <p></p>    
            This segment is further divided into parts according to 3 physical levels, with each level being tougher than previous one but, on the same time, it will give you your results earlier than previos one and it's totally upon you which level of physical training you have to start irrespective of on what level you are now.

        <p style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Beginner</b></p>
        <p>
            You rarely do any physical activity, you feel that your stamina is low, then you may come in this category (which is independent of your body weight to a large extent).

            <p></p>
            You can start with a few things to make yourself fitter and stronger but keep in mind one thing, <span class="highlight">this would not be easy for you</span class="highlight"> but it's something which IS possible.
            
        <p style="font-size: 20px;" id="workout">
            <b>Starting The Day With A Short Workout Session</b></p> 
            <p>There are numerous applications available on Play Store as well as App Store where you can get perfect short (i.e. 15-20 minutes duration) exercises to do along with timers, rep counters and all. You just have to make up your mind and hit that start button.
            
            <p></p>
            An example of such application which is available on Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menloseweight.loseweightappformen.weightlossformen" target="_blank" style="color: cyan;">Lose Weight App for Men - Weight Loss in 30 Days</a>. As you can see this is a overall weight reduction workout application and will genuinly benifit you. Exercising through this method, you won't get bored unlike doing it through YouTube.

            <b>Jog For Half An Hour A Day</b>
        </p> 
        <p>
        Jogging is something which will target your overall body weight but it is obvious that you won't be able to do it for half an hour continuously, so there is a specific rule to keep your body in motion the whole time while jogging/running i.e. without sitting and giving your body a rest in middle of a jog, to make most out of it, I will call it as <span class="highlight" id="10/2"> 10/2 Rule</span class="highlight"> in which you have to jog for the maximum time you can and then once you have totally fatigued yourself, you have to slow down and start brisk walking till it feels like you can start the jog again.
            
        <p></p>    
        Here, 10 denotes a 10 minute run/jog and 2 denotes a 2 minutes brisk walk which you have to do alternately. You can do the jog and walk for whatever time you want, it doesn't necessarily has to be 10 and 2 minutes respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            As being a beginner, now you know how can you start your physical training and after this we will be looking about the diet which is, you can say, more important than exercising. The reason why I am talking such is, you can loose weight by doing a little exercise and concentrating totally on your diet but <span class="highlight">you can not reach the top with just exercise and not focusing on the diet</span class="highlight">. You can jump directly to your nutrition section by <a href="#">clicking here</a>.
        </p>
        <p style="position: relative;  top:10px; font-size: 25px;"><b> Summary (Beginner)</p></b>
        <p>
            To start with your physical training, do a short workout daily in the morning or evening. Other thing which has to be followed is jogging (or running if possible) daily, following the <a href="#10/2">10/2 rule</a> . I have explained the jogging/running process broadly in my <a href="#intrun">Intermediate</a> part.  Now as you know about your physical training, we will focus on your diet, go to <a href="Nutrition.html">Nutrition Segment</a> to know more.

        <p>
            You at times do some physical activities like playing any sort of sport, you can do minimum 10 pushups and you yourself feel your stamina as moderate, then you come in this category. To make yourself fitter and stronger, you have to continue with your sport and other activities which you perform but with a greater intensity from now and along with this you have to add a few things as follows.
            
            <p></p>
            I would like to add that for you to become fitter it's not as difficult as compared to the beginners' ones but this will of course require <span class="highlight"> great determination and discipline</span class="highlight">. The more the days you keep yourself physically active, the more your body will accept your lifestyle change and then, you can easily convert those short time duration workouts into the longer ones.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            <b>Playing The Sport You Like For At Least Thirty Minutes A Day</b>
        </p> 
        <p>
            You should play the sport you like or you are already into for 30 minutes daily. As you know that the ways I am telling you are devoid of any gym equipments, rather deviod of a gym. So you necessarily have to start playing a sport if you are not into one as it is definitly gonna help you.
            
        <p></p>
            The physical activities you perform, the more early you can gain your desired physique. But still if you are not able to find any way to practice a sport, you can always increase the time and intensity of the following methods.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;" id="workout2">
            <b>Practicing A Thirty Minutes Workout Daily</b>
        </p> 
        <p>
            I have already discussed briefly about the ways you can start with daily workouts in the Beginners' section. You can <a href="#workout">click here</a> to skim through it once again but as you are an intermediate, of course there are some changes in rules now. You have to choose an app which will be focusing more on specific parts of your body, for exempli gratia (e.g.) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=legworkout.formen.legsworkoutstraining ">Leg Workouts - Lower Body Exercises for Men</a>.
            
        <p></p>
            By choosing this app for your daily workout sessions, you can directly concentrate on strengthening and shaping your legs, i.e. your calves, thighs, quads, hamstrings and buttocks, though it also has few exercises which will be based on overall weight reduction.
            
        <p></p>    
            Let's consider that you choose this app and it is a five months course then after completing it you can switch to some other app which now will focus on your arms. Just like this, in couple of years, you can have a fit body without joining a gym! Yeah I know it is a long process <span class="highlight">but in the end it is worth it as you will shape your physique without a single extra penny</span class="highlight">.

            <b>Running For Half An Hour A Day.</b>
        </p> 
        <p>
            As we have already discussed about the way you have to run/jog in <a href="#jog">Begnniers' section</a>, i.e. by 10/2 Rule which is running till you don't fatigue yourself completely and then slowding down to start a brisk walk, now we will be going deeper into this section. If you decide to do a 30 minute run daily, set a timer of 15 minutes in your cell phone for first few days. As soon as the timer rings you, have to start running to  your home back, by doing this you'll be able to run for perfect 30 minutes and on the 30th minute, you will reach your home.
            
        <p></p> 
            Runing/jogging on the same route daily will avoid wastage of time in deciding the routes everyday. Once you get habitual of your route and time, try to avoid bringing your smartphones while your runs. In a day, at least 30 minutes you shall give for your body without any electronic distraction and I really don't think that there may be a need of your smartphones while running.
        </p>
        <p style="position: relative;  top:10px; font-size: 25px;"><b> Summary (Intermediate)</p></b>

        <p></p>
            Workout applicaions (available to Play Store and App Store) which will be focusing more on your specific body parts. Consider a certain app has a leg workout course of 5 months, so once you complete this one, you can shift to another app focusing on your arms or chest. Along with 30 minutes sports and workout each, you have to give time for a 30 minutes run daily,  which you will be doing according to the 10/2 Rule
        </p>

    <section>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;"><b>Advance</b></p>
        <p>
         You are into regular physical activities like playing some sort of sport daily or perform workouts on a regular basis, you feel that your stamina and endurance are also good enough, you may come in this category. So, you are the most exprienced, fitter and stronger in the three levels and as you already are into your physical training, you have to focus more on your diet and nutrition, because it is definitly gonna help to get that fit and lean body quickly.

         You can either read this further if you think to make some changes in your physical training or you can directly jump to the <a href="Nutrition.html">Nutrition Segment</a>. The rules are mostly same as the <a href="#intermediate">Intermediate</a> one's but still I would like to suggest you somethings which you can add in your physical training.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">
            <b>Running For An Hour A Day</b>
        <p>
            We have already conversed in deep about the 10\2 Rule which you can follow while running (you can go to <a href="#jog">Beginner</a> and <a href="#intrun">Intermediate</a> segment to read more about that) now I'll give you some tips about what can you do after your run.
            
        <p></p>
            Firstly, if possible you should take a cold water bath because it may reduce your total muscle damage and then you can try having some liqiud electrolyte which can be anything from water to coconut water as it will rehydrate against the fluid your body used while the run.
            
        <p></p>
            Running is the best and most basic physical activity to loose excess body fat or to keep it under control. If you want a fit and slim physique rather than that bulky and heavy one, along with your daily workouts and all, running everyday is preferable.

            <b>Including Workout Sessions in Your Everyday Life</b>

            I have already told a lot about how to use mobile applications to perform regular workouts in the <a href="#workout">Beginner</a> and <a href="#workout2">Intermediate</a> segments. Being an advanced one, you can start from with the application's 2nd or 3rd month schedule as beginning from 1st may limit your gains.
            
        <p></p>
            Though the ways I am telling you are deviod of extra money required but still I would like to tell you that you an of course invest a little amount in certain equipments like dumbbells if you want those big and veiny looking arms. You can even workout with the help of those as increasing the weight you will have to lift is going to increase your gains. 
        </p>

Though the ways I am telling are deviod of any extra amount required but still it is always better if you can invest a little on dumbbells (it will be better if you get a pair of those) if you want those big arms in less time.
