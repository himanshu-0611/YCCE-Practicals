    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a second-year student pursuing Computer Technology @ YCCE Nagpur Campus. I am a great learner, a bibliophile, and very sincere. I find the idea of creating value for people and impacting the world through my work gratifying.<br><br>
        
        âœ… On Instagram, posting quality content regularly on my motivational theme account gave me a chance to work with a non-profit organization - @incredible.humans. They have more than 122K followers and I was hired as their social media manager.<br><br>

        âœ… Soon I will be publishing a website 'fitnessfvr.com' where I will be writing blogs on the importance of regular exercise, good nutrition, and conveying the ways to follow the same. It will be a great guide for the people who are willing to remain healthy and fit.<br><br>

        I am very interested in Machine Learning and it's amazing to learn about its applications in various fields like crime detection, predicting diseases like Parkinson's, use of Big Data to target ads, self-driving cars, creation of unique art and music. I am proficient in C Language.<br><br>

        ðŸ”´ Creating photos and videos and then editing them is my hobby. I have done the same both for myself and as a social media manager. I prefer to use Adobe Premiere Pro and also few minimalistic mobile-based applications.<br><br>

        ðŸ”´ Being a hard-core book reader, I have read books ranging from Bhagwad Gita to Rich Dad Poor Dad. I personally feel I am good at imagining, absorbing the book, then comparing, and applying the knowledge gained in the real world.<br><br>

        ðŸ”´ I enjoy challenges that enable me to grow. I like to find application in what is taught to me and use Feynman and Pomodoro techniques to learn as quickly as possible.<br><br>
